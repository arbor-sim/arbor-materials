        Two HBP prototype systems  installed at \julich. Both are a radical departure from current technology.
        \newemph{left}: IBM Power8+GPU ``fat node''. \newemph{right}: Intel many core KNL ``blade''.
    \end{center}

    Current simulators were designed for single core systems, with parallel implementations added later.
    There are efforts to add many core support to existing codes, however they are subject to the law of diminishing returns.
    This presents an opportunity to start work on the next generation of simulators, designed from the ground up to support diverse many core architectures.
    \newemph{NestMC} aims to fill this gap.

         The first step is to develop a \newemph{sufficiently complex} prototype to inform important design considerations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Explore the trade-offs between abstraction and performance.
            \item Support for representative architectures:
                  multicore, Intel KNL, and GPU.
            \item The features in the prototype test our assumptions and inform the design:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Test \newemph{interopability} with an external API (e.g. LFP).
                \item Test the \newemph{extensibility} of the internal API used to implement algorithms (e.g. gap junctions).
                \item Test an exotic \newemph{back end} (e.g. GPU).
            \end{itemize}
            \item Aim to understand the design space and domain before committing to a design.
