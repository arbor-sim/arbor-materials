Hi all!

Thanks for showing your interest in Arbor! Unfortunately we could not finish the network_ring demo in time. Attached to this email, you'll find the full script.

There are two options to run it:
1. Easiest is to use Google's Colab at https://colab.research.google.com.
   Once you've made a new notebook, you can run:
   !pip install arbor
   This sets up Arbor, which may take a few minutes. After that, you can copy the network_ring demo into the notebook, and modify it if you like.
2. On your own system, you can use the instructions at
   https://arbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/python.html
   A compiler and cmake are required, so this assumes you know how to set those up.

I hope the sessions was of some use to you. If you have a minute, please fill out our feedback form at arbor-sim.github.io/feedback

If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at b.huisman@fz-juelich.de

Cheers,
Brent
