            \item Explore the trade-offs between abstraction and performance.
            \item Support for representative architectures:
                  multicore, Intel KNL, and GPU.
            \item Choose features that test our assumptions and inform the design:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Test \newemph{interopability} with an external API (e.g. LFP).
                \item Test the \newemph{extensibility} of the internal API used to implement algorithms (e.g. gap junctions).
