## feedback on previous release cycles

- have deprecation warning/ breaking changes warning.
    - simulation constructor changes arg other
    - build system made things more complicated (?)
- open issues / double issues / unclear/broad issues.
    - add a reply/follow-up if you can.
    - Brent's task is to backlog pruning.

    - Stochastic diff eqns in mechs
    - Structural plasticity: mutable connection table (+generator rewiring)
  - Stretch goals
    - Distributed gap junctions ()
    - Arbor-compatible NMODL representation of AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses

About Issue cleanup, I was fine with #1709 getting closed (sorry for no response, was on vacation). Mario clarified that it was only needed for a RQ that should be answered if it was 'low hanging fruit' - easy to answer without much work

Comment from Max (he can't join the call, but I asked him for comments on distributed gap junctions): I was done with the exploration, distribtued gap junction simulation works in my branch (validated for numerical equality)
