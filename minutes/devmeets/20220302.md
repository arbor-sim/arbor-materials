# Introduction round

# Goals: 
1. Collect issues from Kanban board (from columns 'next release' and 'in progress' and 'in review') to be implemented until next release v0.7, set priotization and rough timeline; set vision/goal
2. Do the same for next next release v0.8 as preparation

# Summary of v0.6 release

Arbor (https://arbor-sim.org) v0.6 is released, packed with features, new examples, bugfixes and improvements. A selection of new features:

* Arbor-GUI. A comprehensive for tool visiually and interactively building single cell models using Arbor. It is self-contained, fast, and easy to use, and lets you peek into Arbor's brain while it is simulating the configuration you have set up. It lets the user define regions and locsets on their cells, place and parametrize ion dynamics and manipulate cable cell parameters. Furthermore, the simulation itself can be manipulated: timestep, runtime, add probes, stimuli and detectors, discretization, and finally observe traces on probes as the simulation runs. Tutorial included.

* Mechanism ABI. Provides a common C linkage ABI for externally compiled mechanisms, ion dynamics, for both CPU and GPU. The ABI allows users to mechanisms in any language they choose, and compile them separately from Arbor and include them wherever they execute Arbor simulations. In addition this simplifies the maintenance of mechanism "catalogues", so a user can easily package, maintain, disseminate and archive mechanisms; within their lab or with the wider world. The Brain and Behavioral Sciences Laboratory in Pavia, Italy is using this feature to interoperate with their existing mechanism collection.

* User-defined gap junction models. Users can now write custom mechanisms for gap junctions, improving the ability to model synaptic plasticity.

* LFPykit integration. Arbor can now be used as a backend for local field potential calculations. Helper classes ArborCellGeometry and ArborLineSourcePotential are offered as part of a tutorial showing of the new feature.

* Python Package now comes included with SWC .swc, NeuroML .nml, NeuroLucida .asc morphology support, enabling users to work with the vast majority of morphology data out there.

## NeuroML2 Support [1621](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1621)
- External tool, working first version
  https://github.com/thorstenhater/nmlcc
- Converting channels to NMODL 
  - optimised for Arbor (2x-3x speed-up)
  - compiles the whole set for the Arborio IO model
  - includes optimisations we would like to do by hand, 
    but that are way to tedious
    - folding channels into one per region
    - inlining all parameters per region
- Templated single cell simulations
  - meaning:
    - morphology
    - channels exported to NMODL and made available as a catalogue
    - parameter and channel assignments
    - inputs are exported and setup (proper wiring depends on networks)
  - not done and likely not to be done: simulation parameters

- WIP: networks
