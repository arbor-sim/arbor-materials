## HBP collection for Nature

Present: BH, TH, SS, JL, NA

* Ebrains Live Papers: https://ebrains.eu/service/live-papers/
* Example: https://live-papers.brainsimulation.eu/#2021-saray-et-al
    * basically an abstract + links to data and Jupyter Notebooks

## What would we like to submit?

* Robin's paper (is actually in the pipeline)
    * BH
    * one-liner: Cross-comparison of state of the art neuromorphological simulators on modern CPUs and GPUs using the Brain Scaffold Builder.
* Turn https://github.com/arbor-contrib/hodgkin-huxley-sensitivity-analysis into a live paper
    * BH (turn poster into Live Paper)
    * One-liner: To establish the utility of Arbor and to be able to verify the results and claims of Valderrama et al. 2015, we reimplement a sensitivity analysis of the membrane voltage to variation in the parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model using the Sobol method.
* Live paper showing off recent features of Arbor (new features)
    * SS
    * The live paper will give an overview of Arbor and demonstrate its feature will small self-contained interactive examples.
* Live paper on ported synapse model (cf. https://github.com/jlubo/arbor_2N1S)
    * JL
    * A synapse model reproducing the outcome of established plasticity-inducing protocols by featuring early-phase plasticity based on calcium dynamics and late-phase plasticity based on synaptic tagging and capture.
