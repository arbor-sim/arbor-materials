## minutes june 23 2021 meet with EPFL on T5.2 milestone

how about this for test case: https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase

Felix: neuroml: not going to do this. no benefit to scientists/workflow right now. neuroml support for certain features is lacking, requiring flatting of the morpho.

dynamics: already in neuroml

hippocampus mooc already meets M24 milestones. microcircuit in the mooc is already meeting the milestone.

For M30, network description in Sonata format, not NML.

## plan

0. Ask Werner van Geit where the Sonata file is (for the showcase), how the parameter setting happens. Those things are for their fixing.
1. Use https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase as stepping stone to hippocampus mooc.
2. we make the technical analysis neuroml dynamics
    * Can we avoid LEMS implementation? Is there any LEMS in https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase?
3. in september, report estimate/progress to epfl
    * TH volunteers to do the deed ;)
4. when implementation on track, ask them to start working on the morphology converter.
