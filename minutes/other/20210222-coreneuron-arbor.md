# Coreneuron + Arbor bench

Slides+rough agenda:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JXOwRluNpZcKAbKdAJ_sqWNriPK5GBAGE6c62wjAaOM/edit

## Formats

https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/blob/master/share/lib/hoc/import3d/import3d_gui.hoc#L997

### BBP
* Neurolucida + swc
* Strong BPP effort to converge to Sonata
    * pose questions on BBP-interpretation on https://github.com/blueBrain/libsonata

### Neurolucida
* New version: ndx. With actual spec.
    * https://neuromorphological-file-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    * https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.22.306670v1.full

## Paper
* Omar will take CoreNeuron<>Arbor paper to Felix, will come back to us.
    * Abstract deadline is optional.
    * Paper need not be long.
    * Omar sends invite soon on this!
* Topic of the paper:
    * Focus would be on what was required for portability:
        * to generate model descriptions from BBP pipelines that Arbor can consume
        * changes to Arbor required to support models
    * Validation of models: how do you validate model output from the two simulators?
    * Benchmarks would be the final part of the paper (not the main focus)

## Todo
* setup call w/ BBP-Sonata ppl? (Nora?)
    * post questions on bbp interpretation at https://github.com/blueBrain/libsonata
* Omar sends invite soon on paper
* Pramod will get back to us after doing some research on NeuroML, a few more items.
