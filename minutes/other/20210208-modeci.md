### goal: MDF

We are aiming to define a Model Description Format (MDF) which can specify a broad range of computational models which can be expressed as computational graphs.

will build on neuroml, nineml(?), spineml

#### Running thoughts from Sam:

* Level of detail: what constitues a node?
* Communication: discrete events vs continuous time data flow?
* Describing maths: LaTeX is a bit nuts, but other options include e.g. MathML.
* In terms of 'instantiated' or not, this comes down to a question of parameterization. And then: does a particular set of parameters constitute part of the model, or part of the (experimental) environment?
* It 'should' be possible to make a strong split between a declarative model description and an experimental description using some other paradigm.
