## Willem Wybo

I have developed a framework to reduce morphological neuron models (https://elifesciences.org/articles/60936 <https://elifesciences.org/articles/60936>). We further propose an open source Python toolbox to obtain such reduced models in a straightforward way (https://neatdend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html <https://neatdend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>). Currently, our toolbox allows exporting reduced models to NEURON, and we are working on exporting those models to NEST as well.

Our aim, of course, is to allow complete freedom for the users of our toolbox in choosing the neural simulator of their choice. In that respect, we are interested in adding Arbor our selection of neural simulators. I would be happy to have an exploratory zoom meeting to discuss to discuss this.

## Meet 22 april 2021

Willem: dendritic modelling. Synapse-dendrite interaction modelling. Devved simplification: from interactions sites to voltage dynamics.

modellers will get in there, need access to low level stuff thats in principle hidden from the user.

code for neuron is single function.-> makes compartment description for neuron, and sets capacitance, conductance sodium, leak etc., coupling cst to parent (inverse axial resistivity) directly (through neuron python interface)

TODO:
- update CV policy docs
    - include/cv_policy.hpp has cv_policy_explicit and is not in docs, but has no docs for cv_policy_every_segment

Thorsten:

dendtritic computation implies nest isnt enough on its own.
two layers neural network can model any function
2019 paper: plasticity inside a neuron can be modelled as a neural network.
Egidio: also has a 'complexity scaler'
