## FIPPA checkup

1. Sebastian's slides
    - Next steps
        - organisation and priming of long term memory representations with two-phase plasticity (#?)
            - https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01778-y
        - Impl. of axial diffusion of ions (#1651)
- Go over the milestones
    - M18: Initial support for plasticity
        - [X] STDP in Arbor (done as of 0.5.2)
        - [x] Code running w/ plasticity rules
            - Proof: github.com/tetzlab/FIPPA
    - M27: Full support for plasticity
        - SDE support 
          - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
          - Gaussian noise
        - Ca axial diffusion
            - The effect on network simulations of such diffusion is not known yet. No simulations have been done at this scale.
            - Also interesting: transport. But way harder to do.
            - [SY] Diffusion is essentially the same as cable equation
            - As neurons mature, Ca diffusion will less likely to influence other synapses
            - Diffusion rate changes, but slowly (~1d/~1w)
2. Other Business
  - other thing: use Arbor for big simulation at Goettingen
  - using jupyter?
3. Getting funding!
    - CT can help w/ ideas and letters of support regarding plasticity?
    - Q: What sources exist?
        - software dev grants
        - science grants
        - what are the possibilities?
    - Please apply for a compute-project at JSC
        - small ones are fine
        - can also be data stuff
        - eg JUSUF
