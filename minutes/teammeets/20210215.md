Automated Performance Testing [TH]
==================================

I am changing a lot of things at the interface to `modcc`. It would be
good to have automated tests for performance regressions by this and
other things. Does not need to be run at every PR, but maybe once weekly?

Measuring performance on CI is _hard_ though. I would suggest using
instructions executed as a proxy for performance, instead of runtime.
This can be done using `valgrind` or `perf` (if available).

It's even harder to cover GPU performance. No idea here.

- CSCS starting work on better support for historic performance presentation
    - Arbor will be one of the 4 pilot use cases


Partners
========

* Pramod follow-up?
    * Also, Felix approached about writing a paper in Frontiers
* Met with Robin earlier this morning.
* Meeting with Lennart and Rocher tomorrow at 1pm. All provided `nmodl` files provided can be parsed successfully with modcc after some minor changes.


Draft / WIP PRs: debate!
========================



End

TODO and Decisions
------------------

- BC: Implement neurolucida, PR
- SY: Review NA modcc PRs 1373, 1374.
- SY/NA: Make an issue re: modcc CONDUCTANCE.

On paper publishing: general feeling not to publish in Frontiers because reasons. Possible paper topics for Arbor include: reproduce model/experiment; morphological description features; staggered timestepping; â€¦


Next time
