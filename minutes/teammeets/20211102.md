Reminder prep dev meet
======================
Please be reminded that our first prep dev meet takes place on 10th Nov, 10:00-13:00
* VC: https://conf.dfn.de/webapp/#/?conference=979170431&pin=0000
* Notes: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/EWHfSffPQuWI-n3jwmDLYg
* Kanban: https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3

Goals:
* Collect issues from Kanban board (from columns ‘next release’ and ‘in progress’) to be implemented until next release v0.6, set priotization and rough timeline
* Do the same for next next release v0.7 as preparation

ToDo's (for everybody): 
* Please move any issues you (would like to) see in the next release into Kanban board 'next release' until 10th Nov

Reminder HLST report
====================
HLST/DIR requests an internal interim review on HLST efforts (from start of SGA3 until now/WIP) - excluding support vouchers of CEoI grants by end of Nov (see https://drive.ebrains.eu/f/6348c9de5b0243979ca9/) directed to HBP Leadership including, e.g.,

* user-initiated requests leading to direct HLST support actions (e.g., requests through Zammad tickets, EBRAINS Gitlab, Internal Showcases)
* support through tool-specific channels such as mailing lists or issue trackers
* contributions to the development of EBRAINS tools and services, and
* development of documentation and training and tutorial materials

No update from HEP regarding examples, yet. Hopefully this Friday.

In the meantime I would kindly ask you to add all your HLST efforts to the list BH started until **12th Nov** with a note if it's CEoI related. I will then put it into a report.

NA: 
* add porting models as well
* add Open Calls (in separate list)

BC: 
* keep KPIs in WIKI for SGA3 reporting

Complex synapses
================
AMPA, GABA, NMDA - Some version of that was supposed to be implemented by Sam before he left. Will become relevant soon.
    - Contact Sam and ask for status. Ask for his planned steps. Ask for documentation.
    - Contact Stefano, ask for papers, ask for verification.
