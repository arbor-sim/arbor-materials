# Notes

## sam
python probe/sampling (api) design compiles!

## nora

* reductions not best way to go. 5% reduction on gpu...
* cudagraph bench.
* arbor gets max 15% util of SMs, but near-max memory bandwidth utilisation.
    * thorsten: latency is the problem
    
## Arbor v0.5

* python probe/sampling (api) design
* File format for dumping / simulations, ArborIO
    * XML based stuff, (neuroml?)
    * JSON stuff (for the Neurogpu comparison?)
        * paintable, placeable, defaultable
* is cable cell mutable?
    * init w/ morph, dict
    * now I paint, place == mutations.
        * move this to constructor, => immutable cable_cell
    * everything in terms of regions/locsets, instead of m_extents?
        * yes
    * stretch goal: arborIO
* dead links docs.
    * 
* python unit test
    
## tasks
* NORA and I do, refactor cable_cell mutable.
