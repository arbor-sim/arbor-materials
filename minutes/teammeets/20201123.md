Soon more news, current CTA is major problem and should be
replaced/removed.

Potenti

Nora

Docs: probes/sampling, discretization docs missing from the concept
pages. Some restructuring of the cable cell docs is probably needed.
Waiting for the Decor PR to be merged before continuing.

STDP: Started implementation.

Voltage watcher interpolation bug: pointers not being swapped in the
threshold watcher leads to wrong sense of interpolation. Test needs to
be added to catch this bug in the future; plus a bug fix.
