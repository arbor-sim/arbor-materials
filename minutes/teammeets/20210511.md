Arbor team infra
================

email
-----
We have
* arbor-sim@fz-juelich.de. It a bit hard to handle and configure, and only by FZJ staff.
* arborsim@gmail.com. Also used for our calender, Google search management (yes this needs to be managed, otherwise Pramod will find one year out of date URLs again) and conducting questionnaires (Google Docs).
* arbor-sim@protonmail.com.

I prefer the Gmail address, it's a thing a last resort, easy to transfer and work across institutional boundaries. A pity Ebrains does not do that yet, but here we are.

chat
----
Concerning Slack replacements: there is chat.ebrains.eu now. Also juchat.fz-juelich.de. Both rocketchat based.
