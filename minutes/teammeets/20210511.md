About the Origin of Origins
===========================

Specifically how we accommodate user requests for the GUI.

SGA3_Use_Cases_spreadsheet
==========================

https://drive.ebrains.eu/lib/946a10d2-cc48-4195-9150-0e4a62c405fb/file/Docs/SGA3_Use_Cases_spreadsheet.xlsx
Currently, there are no Arbor-related 'use-cases'. Do we want to offer up a few?

* Arbor-gui -> WASM.
* ...

Arbor team infra
================

email
-----
We have
* arbor-sim@fz-juelich.de. It a bit hard to handle and configure, and only by FZJ staff.
* arborsim@gmail.com. Also used for our calender, Google search management (yes this needs to be managed, otherwise Pramod will find one year out of date URLs again) and conducting questionnaires (Google Docs).
* arbor-sim@protonmail.com.
* get our own domain?
    * collect online docs, website in same spot while we're at it.
    * Seb is in favor! Current situation is confusing.

I want to move off @fz-juelich.de. The adddress needs to be easy to transfer and work across institutional boundaries. A pity Ebrains does not do that yet, but here we are.

chat
----
Concerning Slack replacements: there is chat.ebrains.eu now. Also juchat.fz-juelich.de. Both rocketchat based.

PR
--

PRs linger long. Too long. I want to change this. Github confirms: arbor-sim/arbor/pulls is our most visited page! See also Seb getting impatient after ~2-3 days: for me it is no different! Branches go stale, minds too, having to wait long on review and merging isn't good for anyone. Also, our dream of a community project means PR review is hopefully the main task of team member, so it would be good practice :) What's a good way to speed this up? Shall we have a goal for maximum shelf time?
