About the Origin of Origins
===========================

Specifically how we accomodate user requests for the GUI.

Arbor email address
===================

We have arbor-sim@fz-juelich.de. It a bit hard to handle and configure, and only by FZJ staff.
We also have arborsim@gmail.com. Also used for our calender, and conducting questionnaires.

I prefer the Gmail address, it's a thing a last resort, easy to transfer and work across institutional boundaries. A pity Ebrains does not do that yet, but here we are.
