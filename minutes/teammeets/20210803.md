Collaborative editing: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/new
Turn Issues and PRs you want to discuss into agenda items.

Presence:

## GUI

- AppImage being worked on
- PVS reports
- Simulation support

## Parameter Optimization

BC: spoke with the author of Korali
* https://github.com/cselab/korali
* Batching of parameters (i.e. packing multiple cells into a single model) possible, but a bit hacky
    * happy to work with us on a batching interface
    * I am trying to make a single cell optimization web app our showcase for an EU project.

TH: Working on L2L
* Getting stuck on `-inf` fitness
* Anything to be learned from bluepyopt, they measure not just voltage traces.
* _Probably_ because _g >= 0_

## Conferency stuff

* IBRO-Ebrains: 2 attendees
    * They may be setting up a course, but they didnt seem to have any programming exp
* Bernstein 2021 poster abstract submitted

## Ebrains

* Spack on EBrains works, they don't build from our ebrains repo however. Someone knows more?
* Ebrainsy stuff, organizing rebellion against Marc
    * TODO: Write down Ebrains complaint, for Ben to send to Collin.

## LFPy performance

* Espen has made a model based on both Arbor and NEURON, getting poor performance at higher cell counts. Haven't looked at detail why yet (SY) but can share the model.

* Also: [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/discussions/1614) re: alpha synapse model (like exp2syn but where τ₁=τ₂) — looks like a good candidate for inclusion in default catalogue.

## PVS Analysis

- Made three bucket PRs
- Quite pleasant to use, but seems a bit more lenient than clang-tidy
- Getting a license is easy
- Have to check how to add to CI

## Sams departure ;_;

* When exactly? SY: last working day 17th September; leaving CH October 9.

* What to hand over?
    * Lfpy? Maybe [AK] -> Chat with Espen
    * CoSim? [TH] -> Chat with Wouter

## ArbLang

Status:

* NA has some prototype parsing code up.
* SY has finalized a lexical grammar; writing up surface syntax more formally.
* Hackathon end of august: try to port some BBP/Allen mechs to Arblang.

## Partners

* (text-only updates preferable)

## Other Issues & PRs

* https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3
* https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pulls

## End

## TODO and Decisions

- Espen's LFPy thing: BC volunteers to help!
* [BH] Write down Ebrains complaint, for Ben to send to Collin.
* Hackathon end of august: try to port some BBP/Allen mechs to Arblang.
