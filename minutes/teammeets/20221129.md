## Exact sampling

- Problem for fixed timestepping?
    - If we step over to fixed timestep, there is not longer exact sampling (can't sample at arbitrary points in time).
    - How do we want to handle that?
        - we can just insert timesteps at sampling points.
    - paves way for distr. gap junctions.
    - simplifies code significantly.
- Have new policy that aligns timesteps best with the sampling rate?
    - New schedule: integer timesteps.
- Who requested this?
    - Ask in channel
