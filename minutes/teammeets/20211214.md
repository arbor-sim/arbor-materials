Meson vs. CMake
================

* Ben has a working implementation of most of Arbor's CMake
    * still missing:
        * out of tree catalogue builds
        * CUDA/HIP
        * A few other little features
* Overall meson is much better
    * always produces shorter and more readable implementations
    * documentation is much better than 
    * much faster to configure and build
* Issues
    * exporting compilation flags via pkgconfig is a work in progress
    * CUDA support is still experimental
* setup.py
    * scikit-build, but only does CMAKE...
