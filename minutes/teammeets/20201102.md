## File format standardization (20 min)

eBrains working group on file standards for simulation _output._ Doodle: [https://doodle.com/poll/ftvkikax4xmvu8af](https://doodle.com/poll/ftvkikax4xmvu8af?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link)

I think we should engage with a small plan/strategy to make sure our problems wrt badly specified file formats. First of all, let's widen scope: also simulations input file formats. Second, can we produce, per file format, a paragraph, with an example if possible, for common file format shortcomings?

Other platforms for this issue: OCNS?

To define outputs, you must define inputs. What does voltage on cell 37 mean?
