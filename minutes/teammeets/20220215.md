    - late feb second meet
- A virtual hackathon before Nora leaves, sometime march
    - JEWELS will be beginning march, maybe combine? prevent clash?

Nora's Plans
============

- on boarding Simon and Fabian with tasks that will give them a crash course of Arbor
    - Simon: inhomogenous parameters
    - Fabian: Stochastic ODEs
- hand over Arblang to Simon and Fabian
    - partners Arborio (Robin, Lennart)
    - Focus on end to end code gen for a simple mechanism

NeuroML and BluePyOpt
=====================

- we need to understand what generating "NeuroML" means in the context of BBP models.
- https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/blob/master/bluepyopt/ephys/templates/cell_template.jinja2#L136
- We did not do a very good job at clearly defining TODOs
    - confusion: decor -> json or nml or acc?
        - [BH] pretty sure Werner will come up with a time estimate for 'NML export'
    - how do we validate? we let ourselves be deflected
- We did not hold them accountable for their TODOs.
    - Thorsten can follow up with Werner immediately to clarify what we are proposing to generate from BluPyOpt.
    - 

Hackathon ideas
===============

- Arbcoin
- AMPA/GABA Synapses
- nmlcc
- full stack feature: inhomogeneous parameters or SDE, BYO cellgroups
- Arblang
