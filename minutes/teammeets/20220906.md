## Open PRs

- many...

## Memory blow up with 2B cells

- context: trying to saturate as many nodes as possible.
- cause candidates:
    - concatenated label->lid map.
    - all spikes in the first epoch


## Lukas + Thorsten met Werner

 - went over [#393](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/pull/393), few remaining requests regarding myelin sectionlist crash in Neuron and accurate resolution (segment-level) axon replacement, will follow up in September week 3/4
 - [BluePyOpt feature list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmQgjWrSFpX585iJUxMA-EwYMQx1azCT3P2xyGpuw4I/edit?usp=sharing)  with outlook towards supporting Arbor as an optimization backend. Proof of concept for this is priority, frontend is currently not changed by ACC exporter, so Neuron-specific - we need to revisit this.
 - NMODL is not the issue for [K_Tst divergence](https://github.com/lukasgd/BluePyOpt-utils/blob/master/validation/all-regions/l5pc_soma_arbor_axonal_K_Pst.ipynb) (pattern remains the same when driving Neuron with Arbor's NMODL after adding the ASSIGNED block)
 - should do a scipy-integrate test of single-compartment model: coupled system of ODEs for m, h, voltage with no spatial discretization (but need to get the control volume right). FB: consider adding this as an integration test, TH: possibly even simpy (?)
