## BPO

- Is there anything to say? In the unlikely case Lukas is present, I'd like to hear from him.
- Werner closed #422 (PR created by Anil), so that Lukas can reopen.

## v0.8

- It's time. #2028 pls review/merge so I can get the rest done.
- Reminder for those absent last time: use the bug tag for bugfixes, and reviewer are asked to focus on turnover time.
- [BH] We did not make a decision on timed releases. I am currently in favor of them, at least for a few months.
- [BH] Can we add prefixes to PR titles? BUGFIX, BREAKING, FEATURE to start with.
    - Agreement! Let's this.
