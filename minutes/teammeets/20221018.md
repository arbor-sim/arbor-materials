## Release 0.8

- Overdue by almost a month
    - Was rescheduled for next week! All/most open PRs going in would be great, if not merged, then they're up for next round.
    - Correct about re-schedule, this is just a hint that we are behind. Also, there's some things we need and some we direly need. Version bumps are of the first kind, the GTest/memory corruption the second.
- What needs to go in and is likely to be doable?
  - Version bumps 
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1815
      - overdue, removes deprecated/unsupported compilers, OSs, ...
          - Open ticket, some things have been bumped.
      - meshes with next item
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/2002
      - keep ahead of GH's CI upgrades
      - also, GH seems to randomly kill deprecated jobs
  - GTest upgrade 
    https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/2003
    - fixes our use of an ancient version of GTest.
    - might fix spurious, but penetrant CI failure
  - a-b-c 
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/2003
      - decouple a-b-c and arbor's installation
      - in theory one a-b-c instance might be used with multiple libarbor installations. Even/Especially in venv
      - blocked(?) on Robin
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1990
      - fixes a misconfiguration of the modcc binary lookup
  - API breaking changes
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1978
      - blocked on the GTest problem?!
    - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1979
      - some changes needed, might benefit from growing a bit
  - BPO support 
    https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1959/files
      - blocked on TH ;)
      - good to have so we can make BPO an official thing
- What should go in, but is not ready?
  - NMLcc
    https://github.com/thorstenhater/nmlcc 
    - external tooling.
    - still to many rough edges and bugs.
    - Lennart and me are working on it.
  - LIF Probes
    https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1263
    - has been urgently requested by @schmitts and is needed for his project.
    - Status?
  - SDE examples and tutorials 

## GTest and/or Corruption

- CI reports various kinds of memory corruption
- FB tries upgrading GTest, probably needs to have printers for all relevant objects
- SF tries to get the CI container to run locally.
  - please put this in dev/doc
