Off: TH, AK, BC, Lukas

Fabian: update Ben: he'll join the vision meet. Fabian feels it's not a prio for him either.

Off next week: Fabian.

Simon: no updates

Brent: Can't discuss the topic of Arbor design decisions (which reviewer 2 brought up) without BC/TH, so postponed to next week.

Assigned some PRs for review.
