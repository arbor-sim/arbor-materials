## SDE
- Euler-Maruyama solver
- problem: x' = tau*x, where tau=f(x): tau is treated as if tau was a constant for Cnexp solver
    - E-M solver now does similar things as sparse solver: replace tau with its definition (recursive substitutions)
    - Nora's arblang will do full name resolution which avoids this problem
- to do: vectorized code (printer)

## Single cell optimziation

 - made PR with simplecell/l5pc to get feedback from BluePyOpt people
   - formatting needs improvement
   - added feedbacks from Nora
   - common optimization request (from Neuron): not simulating whole Axon with replace_axon (Ben's opinion needed on how to do this in arbor)
       - [BH] Not sure if useful, here a start for how it's done in AllenSDK:
           - https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/issues/1683
   - Werner from BluePyOpt:
     - wanted to know about ACC
     - wants Arbor simulation results from ACC output and compare to Neuron results from generated HOC
