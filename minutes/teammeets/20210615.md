Arbor v0.6/v0.5.1
=================

* Goal: have binary Python wheel up before OCNS (june 30+)
* Include #1583, #1543, and #1504
    * Latter changes API, which was already changed after v0.5, so by including it we avoid changing released API twice.
    * Sam reviews #1504
    * Sam: #1583: things not related to correctness can wait.
    * Sam: #1543.
* Must be done this week!
* For Pypi Ben is required.
    * Thursday morning. Backup: friday early morning just.
* v0.5.1

Ebrains Asia conf
=================

We have been asked to prepare a tutorial for Asian neuroscientists (likely experimentalists) on Arbor. They ask if there can be 2 or more tutors. Anyone else interested?

- Let's ask Robin. If not available, then Sam can step in.

Hidden visibility
=================
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1559
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1510/files
- [NA] - Not a lot of experience deling with this. But seems related to the "Problems with Exceptions" section here: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility. Basically, `typeinfo` symbols of arbor classes are hidden but are required for `dynamic_cast` to work correctly.
- The original problem was triggered by these lines in pyarb:
  ```
   auto result = arb::parse_label_expression(desc);
   std::any_cast<arb::region&>(*result);
  ```
  But it also seems to be triggered here:
  ```
  try {
    cells[i] = any_cast<cable_cell&&>(rec.get_cell_description(gid));
  }
  catch (std::bad_any_cast&) {
    throw bad_cell_description(rec.get_cell_kind(gid), gid);
  }
  ```
- [SY] I think we have to commit to decorating visibility on everything public in the Arbor lib.

Mac mini
========
* It has arrived.
* Will set up ssh access today.


Stack overflow in the task system
=================================
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1570
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1583

* Fix has been implemented.
* Ideas for additional unit tests would be appreciated. NA has added a few tests that triggered the stack overflow bug before the fix.
* `task_system` ubench is not great. I think what we are measuring is essentially the overhead of the `std::this_thread::sleep_for()`.
   * [SY] Should we have an issue for making a better benchmark/stress test?
       * [BH] After the release in another PR.

Partners
========

* Lennart from arborio has started working again.
* Issue with slow simulation initialization slowing down optimization rounds.
* Revisit parameterizable recipe.
