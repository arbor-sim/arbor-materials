## Absences and holidays

- AK: off until further notice (probably next year?)
  - TH: AFAIK the due date is roughly 8.8. I am *guessing* a stay of a year like this time. 
- LD: Back in July
- TH: Move/KITA troubles. Till when?
  - KiTa back in business, as announced
  - Move is 5.7.
  - *Then* vacation 10.-24.7.
- BH: Aug 8-19
- F
- S

## PR review

- Not helped by absences, but a major new problem it seems. Needs more time from all of us. How can we do this?
    - Co-review?
    - TH: allocate some time for it by default? Have a bot assign and pester people.
- WÃ¥sa sank in 17th century
- run through of open PRs; have reviews in by wed, BH starts release thurs.

## Partners

- Sandra and Maria/Lennart

## FYI / Announcements (no discussion)

- Plasticity
    - Max Lenz (Freiburg), Prof
    - Han Lu
    - Had call with Han Lu and Max(imilian) Lenz (Freiburg): they're very interested in modelling their experimental data
      - Will share samples
      - Slices, Spines (esp Volume thereof), Segmentations
    - General interest: how does a network compensate for lesions/ localized loss of activity? Synapse formation and decay.
    - Experimental data and observations:
        - spine density, spine volume.
        - anti epileptic drugs (AED) change apical dendrite volume (not basal!)
        - intracellular (== internal to cell) Ca2+ is decisive correlant with such activity
    - Modeling:
        - How to generate/decay synapses in Arbor
            - start by pregenerating them
            - later: TH brought up a technique in an earlier meet.
        - Comeup with connectivity rules
            - Requires intracellular Ca2+, so need to measure intracellular Ca2+. Request is to track the subthreshold dynamics. Updates should happen on every pre-synaptic spike arrival. Can be optional, if we want to track the calcium concentration of the whole neuron or specific synaptic contacts.
    - By september Maximilian wants grant application written.
