Gap junctions
=============

https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1600

- Max is interested. Suggested adding new explicit gap-junctions mechanisms.
- [NA] Still thinks that adding a way to implement this through NMODL is worthwhile. It is the only way to implement stateful gap-junctions. But if we're going to allow additional explicit gap-junctions, and that's all arborio needs, NMODL gap-junctions can wait perhaps until we have arblang.
- **Questions**:
    - Should we implement NMODL gap-junctions now?
    - Do we do it ourselves? Or guide arborio devs? We haven't discussed distribution of responsibilities when it comes to changes to arbor.
        - We encourage them to fork and try things out.
        - We then do things our way.
    - Questions to arborio:
        - If they want to contribute to arbor (How do you want to contribute?). If yes, point to issue for questions and to the contribution guidelines.
        - How many gap-junction models they have in mind. (SY: If there are only a handful of stateless GJ models in the literature, then a switch-on-enum might just be fine.)


Arbor presentations
===================

- Can now be found here: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor-materials/tree/master/presentations
- Presentations were just copied, so original authors and history are lost.
- https://github.com/eth-cscs/bernstein can be archived.

-> Turn tutorials and workshop materials into jupyter notebooks
    - SY: example of good tutorial structure: http://steps.sourceforge.net/manual/manual_index.html
