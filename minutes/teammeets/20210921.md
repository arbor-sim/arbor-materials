Arbor Team Meeting 2021 09 21
=============================

Meeting link: https://meet.google.com/kod-knuo-pie
Collaborative editing: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/new
Turn Issues and PRs you want to discuss into agenda items.

Presence: NA, AK, TH, BH, NK

Gap Junctions
=============
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1600

- Almost ready for review. Just missing docs. Will include modcc changes as well. Needs https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1657. 

ACC loading/writing speed
=========================
- Profiling shows that writing a cable-cell with a ~5000 segment morphology takes around 1.1s. Loading it takes around 0.2s. 
- Time seems to be spent creating/destroying `s_expr` objects, whose state includes a `std::variant` of a `std::unique_ptr`. 
- Performance is acceptable for now. If it becomes an issue later, we can optimize. 
- In debug mode this is very slow (8s for the allen example), release becomes ok-ish (1.5s)

L2L
===
- Re-write in terms of ACC + list of parameters to be optimised
- Alper & Sandra
  - Fix-up/Tune Optimisers
  - Test GD Optimiser
  - Hackathon: Put *many* instances on a single GPU

NeuroML
=======
- Pull in LEMS and NML2 schemata

WR
==
- toy example, coupled heat equations

Partners
========
- Sebastian helped Robin fix an issue with his model, which was great. We should take a look at the tool Robin created based on Sebastian's suggestion, and fix it up/publish it somewhere.
    - This will be part of the publication that we (BH and RdS) should really start working on.
- Mario asked me (BH) for a 1-1 meet this week. He's not yet replied to my timeslots.
- Meeting with Microsoft Azure people on Wed, 29th (AK, TH, BH)

Arblang
=======
- Had a call with Sam yesterday.
- We discussed adding some sugar to the langauge to make it easier for users who might not want to use a syntax that's quite unusual.
