## Round of updates

- [BH]
    - v0.7 release severely delayed, but after #1916 and #1917 are in, I'm going ahead.
        - 1916 is a must have: it fixes the MacOS wheel build, and simplifies the Python build instructions. They now all live in `pyproject.toml` (moved from ci scripts, setup.py), only the default CMAKE args continue to need to live in setup.py
        - 1917 Fixes unupdated line number and copy due to an earlier merge.
    - This is all too late for the OCNS tutorial I give on thursday :/ But I'll be prepping that this week too.
    - Perf comp update: we received a threat last week (publish now or we drop it), but I think we'll get time to add what we can in terms of a threeway comparison. Robin just wrote that Pramod wrote a fix letting Robin run _some_ of the mechanisms.
    - TAQT training materials at

- [TH] Last few weeks
  - Python: Formatting and Static Analysis into CI
  - Python/C++: Streamline simulation setup
  - C++: Run PVS again, fix some issues brought up
  - NML2: Merge network support. I hate it.
  - Arbor diffusion merge.
  - Tons of review stuff.
  - Plasticity:
    - write dev docs on status quo.
    - start sketching APIs.
    - hash out details with users
  - Just registered to Bernstein Conf 22 / Berlin.

- [BC] fixed `dt` refactoring
    - GPU implementation working with all tests passing
    - 10-25% speedup on `ring` benchmark for multicore and gpu backends
    - However there is a performance pessimisation due to serialisation of event deliver over all events on a cell group (ring example generates effectively no events: busy ring blows up)
        - is currently present also for cell groups with few integration domains due to gap junctions
        - I will start working on an optimised implementation that will probably require ABI breakage.
    - Tempted to start collecting event delivery statistics 
    - Sam has sensed a disturbance in the force

- [FB] work on backend
    - last week: busy with some other work
    - shared state now holds a reserve of random numbers
    - advantage: vectorized/GPU specializations became much simpler
    - currently testing/performance measurements
