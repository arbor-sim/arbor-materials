Arblang
=======
- Full language specification is in PR (Thanks Sam!) https://github.com/arbor-sim/arblang/pull/2
- Meeting postponed till Thursday 1-3 pm and will include CPS discussion/ IR decision.
- Compiler implementation has started, draft PR is up https://github.com/arbor-sim/arblang/pull/1.
    - Work resumes soon, GJ implementation to take precedence. 

Next release
============

- Mech ABI is merged, not released.
- Should we wait for complex GJ?
    - probably not, will need to rev the ABI though
- Need CI on AMD GPUs. Or manual testing should be added to the [release process](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/wiki/Release-Process) until ROCM/the build environment on ault is more stable.
    - master is broken on AMD, needs a `dim3{}` for kernel launch; has `{}` only.
- GUI?
    - release together with v0.6?

Partners - M18 deadline
=======================

(https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/4)

## Arborio:
- Milestones:
    - M18 (10/2021) SC3 T5.18: Arbor Implementation of the Inferior Olive Network (ArborIO) (SC3) Arbor IO v.3 with glomeruli Arbor IO v.3 running on EBRAINS.
    - M18 (10/2021) SC3 T5.18: Arbor Implementation of the Inferior Olive Network (ArborIO) (SC3) MultiGPU feasibility study Implementation strategy in place.
        - old notes
           - blocker is gap junctions
           - Sam, Nora, Max would keep working on distributed GJ implementation.
           - Point was made that both the Cerebellum and Olive networks will need distribute gap junctions at scale.
- Previously agreed upon to-do list: 
    - Stochastic processes in mechanisms for v0.2 olive.
    **[Status: workaround for integrated solution implemented using mech ABI and Random123 lib. Integrated solution still expected.]**
        * Sam to at least describe the math and sketch plans before he leaves.
    - Axial (we call it radial) diffusion for v0.2 olive (generated from NeuroML).
    **[Status?]**
        * support using NMODL hacky approach
        * no plans for NeuroML
    - fancy pants gap junctions for v0.3 olive (M18)
    **[Status: In progress https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1600]**
    - ODE descriptions of GABA etc. synapses for Scaffold (M18). 
    **[Status?]**
        * Sam todo soon(ish)
    - A detailed plan and POC for distributed gap junctions (M18).
    **[Status?]**
        * Lea to start analysis and work on understanding validating of different approaches
- Also discussed: Two parallel tracks.
    1. Take Arbor features of the shelf to build bootstrap model, can we then extend the models with things like distributed gap junctions without slowing down from vanilla version.
    2. Architectural discussion about the simulator.
- TODO
    - Brent: mail Mario?
        - wait for gap junction stuff.
        - they all good for his report?
        - if needed, we can plan a meet

## Fippa: 
- Milestones: 
    - M18 (10/2021) SC3 T5.16: The Functional Interplay between Plasticity Processes for Arbor (FIPPA) Extension of Arbor for initial support of plasticity and beta-release of code Arbor running with test plasticity rules.
    **[Status: Pretty much achieved, add small networks and analysis to example?]**
- Fippa roadmap: 
    - Voltage/calcium based plasticity
        - Cf. Clopath (2010) and Graupner/Brunel (2012)
        - A combination of both is suggested in Hiratani/Fukai (2017)
    - Calcium (longitudinal diffusion/along the x axis)
        - Calcium “state” could be shared within a region
        - Diffusion (cf. Yasuda (2017)) needs new functionality
    - Dendritic spikes
        - Approximate with HH or via a custom neuron mechanism?
- TODO
    - Brent: mail Sebastian:
        - he all good for his report?
        - priorities for us not clear.

Misc
====

* Prof. Peter Tass (Stanford University) is interested in collaborating with/using Arbor for exploring the changes induced by stimulation to the target homeostatic firing rate of the neurons. Contact via Sandra Diaz (FZJ).
