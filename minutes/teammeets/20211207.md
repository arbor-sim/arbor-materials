# Thorsten
- I'll try to compress my update here

## NML2
- Working output, got compiling catalogues. 
- Need to polish the CLI
- Functionality misses the option to in-place extend NML2
- [BH] take a look at C Elegans repo.
- [NA] will send sth from Lennert

## L2L
- Writing on the paper
- Hacking on resume functionality this week
- Maybe need a more clever loss function
  - Feature extraction, eg https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02718-3.pdf by our old friend Anton
  - but: I am not remotely an expert

## arbor-build-catalogue
- See pull/1784
- Getting closer to a final result
  - Still needs wheel on manylinux
  - ~~CLI args need to go through~~ Done

Partners
========

* Robin's full model has been generated. Need to help him setup his environment on piz daint so he can run simulations.
    * [BH] He told me _he_ would do this! We had a call last week on the paper, and he thought he'd have the benchmark data after the weekend. He wants to write something this week, and I'll review.
    * [BH] Gets aquinted with Piz Daint and running Robins model/code.
* AMPA/NMDA synapse papers: (https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1764)
    > Short (technical) summary: In Neuron's nmodl, connections (NetCon objects) can have state attached to them, so we can be in a situation where n presynaptic sites are connected to 1 synapse, and each time one of the presynaptic sites spikes, the connection-local state can alter the synapse-local state. (I asked Robin about how they use these synapses in their model and he said that they actually don't connect a synapse to more than 1 pre-synaptic source, so the connection-local state can in theory be converted to synapse-local state. That sounds inefficient, so it may be a misunderstanding or a bug in the model.).

    * Good news: not as complex as we thought. Bad news: maybe only for specific scenario (?)
    * [BH] How urgent is this issue, and we should address Nora's call for help last week with this, because it's a large new feature.
    * Is there an Issue? https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1764 We need to find a way to share insight/understanding, and a 'thing' we can ask feedback on from the partners, whose feedback we need.
    * [NA] is setting up a paper discussion meeting with Arbor team
* Electrical gap junctions that can receive synapses: (https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1709)
    * Suggested by Lennart: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24656244/

Other Issues & PRs
==================

* Team training [AK, BH]: 
    * finalized justification letter to get funding
    * if funding goes through, agreed on in-person training (place tbd (DÃ¼sseldorf?), time tbd (spring 2022))
        * CSCS would need to cover own travel costs
    * maybe combine with mini-hackathon, and team event, team dinner
* [AK] Mainly worked on HLST report, and some minor reporting for Arbor
    * T5.2 meet today 15:00? [BH] is going
* [NA] Friday: Sonata kickoff (NA on expert panel)
* [AK] Mentor for EC project, 3 days in Jan.
* [FB] working besides SDE on `hidden_visibilit` issue
* [LK] making progress getting orientated in code and started writing code
* https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3
* https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pulls
