  - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1958
      - Assign: Lennart
  - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1990
    [TH] Why someone, I already had some review comments? Also, I'd like to merge the a-b-c/auto-gpu first, should be way easier to get 1990
  - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1959
    Lukas' BPO support. We should give a hand to update this and merge it ASAP.
    - Assign: TH
  - https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1979
    - CI tells me cyclic depenency isn't allowed for shared libraries.
    - add give_me_best_local_context() to arborenv.
        - make Py use this instead.
- Any other PRs?
- add breaking changes to commit log
- agree to add keyword "Breaking API" to PRs that break.
    
## L5b Py / NML2

Progress being made, all sorts of bugs found and fixed.

## Arbor emscripten (accessibility)

 - Ported arbor + pybind11 to emscripten: https://llandsmeer.github.io/arbor-online/
   - Also works as an alternative plaform to EBRAINS / google colab / etc to run CPU-only Inferior Olive DEMO
 - NeuroML morph import doens't yet work due to libxml2 dependency
     - Consider pugixml or other xml lib as workaround
 - Next target is arbor gui & PR for CMake ARB_MODCC flag
 - Cool!
 - matplotlib has a emscipten port
    - if seaborn doesnt, then port all examples, such they can be plotted on the web.
    - have button in docs: load tutorial in Arbor Playground.
    - have build script for Arbor Playground (seems not to exist in https://github.com/llandsmeer/arbor-online/)
 - Arbor-GUI emscripten
    
 
PR's:

 - Getting NeuroML support working on an emscripten target (maybe switch xml backend like pugixml, maybe use the emscripten port of libxml2)
 - Add ARB_MODCC interpretation to CMakeLists.txt
 - Move arbor python example to using matplotlib/seaborn something that works on both desktop/pyodide
 - Add build scripts 
 
## FYI / Announcements (no discussion)

- ..

## Parking Space

- CI: thoughts about a better/more general CI/CT setup with dedicated containers
    - hierarchy of containers can be built (matrices of configurations produce the outer product)
    - no need for caches
      [TH] caches are gone now, at least from the main path. We could use `ccache` and a cache _action_ though to speed up builds.
    - could be stored in GitHub Packages registry
    - access control with GITHUB_TOKEN
- Let's optimize things where time is going: pip install and Arbor build.
    - TH: tries ccache Github Action
    - FB: tries Ninja build for test everything

## Questions

- Can anyone ask Ben about removing CSCS-CI from the repo?
    - Will take a look
    - New hardware coming up "this week"(tm), more stable.
- Have Arbor Christmas release?
