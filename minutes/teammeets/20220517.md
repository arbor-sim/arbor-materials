## Robin's Paper

In the discussion, we're arguing (and no nudging of Robin was required) for good specs helping the user. A reviewer is going deep on a tangent here. While I do not think we need to join the reviewer in going too deep into this (the paper should not be motivating Arbor design choices.), they are correct that we don't have a lot of substance to, case in point, the differences in Arbor's NMODL w.r.t. NEURON's NMODL (not in docs, not in Akar 2018). We're not making good on the promise of well-specced formats. It would be great to have this substance, because for as long as the sun burns, neuroscientists are going to wonder why strictness over convienience is really in their interest. And that is ideally specific; x was changed/is different for reason y. Can we have Ben/Sam/Nora write this up?

DUe to absence of TH, BC, postpone till next week.

## BluePyOpt integration 

- [PR](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/pull/393): tests fixed, addressed issues (no axon replacement with Arbor)
- main open points are 
  - Arbor/NEURON comparison similar to Allen tutorial
  - myelinated sectionlist: "a cylinder attached to the end of the AIS to prevent boundary effects. It doesn't have channels but just represent a myelinated chunk of axon"
