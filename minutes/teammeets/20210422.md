Turn Issues and PRs you want to discuss into agenda items.

Presence: BH, TH

ARM, M1 Macs, CI, and all that
==============================

- CI does not have ARM.
- GH has vague plans to add M1 Macs,
  but currently MacOs 12 is not even supported
- So, things like https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1495
  might break our other ARM builds.
- Can we add ARM somehow?
- Related: Building on Ault `a64fx` breaks due to `std::filesystem`. :-1:

Comment BH: Users are helped with as much platform support as possible. Therefore:
* no std::filesystem, seems to hinder users. Even with binary Python wheels, macos <10.15 users won't be able to run them.
* Can we do manual arm testing, say, at least before a new release?
    * Does the x86-64 build run on M1?
    * Self hosted Linux ARM? https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners
    * QEMU on GA: https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action

TH: They are helped, until they are not. What we cannot test, we do not really support.
Agree. But does it need to be tested in CI? It can be done intermittently, manually, if we have access to an M1.
I'll ask JSC for one
- We agreed on dropping std::fs already. That remark was just aimed at: We do not test this enough.
    - OK
- x86 builds run on M1 via Rosetta, but might loose some performance.
    - Is acceptable to me, until we can test on M1.
- Self-hosted ARM sounds cool, but I would suggest using bors before that.
    - There are some QEMU-based actions, see above.

Conclusion:
1. Make Issue to track Fujitsu A64FX support through bors (only way to test SVE)
2. Find access to an M1 to run tests for as long GA does not have M1-instances.

Please review

GUI (update)
============

- Cable Cell I/O
- Running from GUI will need a specialised recipe,
  due to missing information in ACC
  - Time, dt, ...
  - Catalogues used
  - Probes
  - CV policy
- Next
  - Running simulations
  - CV view.
