Arbor Team Meeting 08.02.2021
=============================

Collaborative editing: Copy-paste to <https://demo.hedgedoc.org/new>?

Presence
--------
* TH, BH, BC, NA, SY


Issues
------

* TH's efforts to retire Travis and replace with GH Actions are "complete"
    * See #1338 "Retire Travis" and "Expand GH CI" #1337
    * We have reproduced Travis
    * Will add **one** additional testcase +SIMD -MPI
* Docs: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1353
    * Python autodocs issue has been updated with more rationale https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1172
* Cable cell formats: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1336
    * Request for ~opinion~ rationale.


PRs
---

* CI Test failing on the EBRAINS GitLab CI, because they are automatically running our gitlab.com tests for Daint.
    * It isn't obvious how to have a mirrored GitLab repo run different tests (i.e. not in `.gitlab-ci.yml`)
    * https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1356


How to use Kanban
=================

* New org-level dev board at https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/3
    * Can add issues from all arbor-org repos.
* Issues only? (No PRs)
    * [You can manipulate the status of Issues with keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/)linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword
* Close the old one? https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/projects/13
    * Yes! Done.
* What do we do with the Coop board? https://github.com/orgs/arbor-sim/projects/2
* Milestones? https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/milestones
    * Close the old ones (long finished).
    * Don't create new ones (use the "Next Release" kanban column for collecting tasks to complete the next release)
* [Bug tag?](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug)
    * Not urgent.

GUI
===

* Do we (I?) continue this effort or do we aim for NetPYNE and ilk?
    * BC: I think that this is important to continue. A responsinve, focussed, application for experimenting with single cell models in Arbor will be good for onboarding users, and much more useful for model development than tools designed around NEURON
    * TH: That's certainly my stance, but I am almost as certainly biased, so I wanted to make this a neutral question.
* arbor-sim/arbor-gui?
    * After cable cell format is in GUI

Partners
========

* Pramod mail Feb 2.
    * Setup meet to resume discussion?
    * Reference: [NMC Portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit).
    * NA: there is a PR on the cnrn-arb-cell repo: https://github.com/bcumming/cnrn-arb-cell
* 4pm ArborIO kickoff tomorrow
    * BC: working on the slides.
    * NA: gap junction requirements include more complex formulations (see linked papers: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735893/ and https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.1999.82.2.804)
        * We'll have to refactor the non-distributed GJ implementation as well as add a distributed implementation.
* Chat with Marcel from in-situ pipeline project.
    * He's the contact for "in-situ pipeline project"
* FIPPA kickoff/meeting necessary?
    * Invite Sebastian schmitt to arborio meeting.
