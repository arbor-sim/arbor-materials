- L
    - comp voltage traces NRN vs Arbor, soma cell in Bluepyopt
    - axon replacement :)
        - they use NRN features to calc radius
        - tried to replicate in Arbor
        - earlier fun with truncated axons (Allen SDK): https://docs.arbor-sim.org/en/latest/tutorial/single_cell_allen.html

## Fippa

SS has problems. Uncertain if they continue with Arbor. Asked fi they're considering writing grants involving Arbor:

    Yes and no. He's the Prof., so he has to do the final decision. 
    But if I would have a good proposal, I'm sure he would support it.
    However, I'm a bit out of ideas to be honest.
    
Their FIPPA project is a bit stuck. Asked on current status, this reply:

    Not very far unfortunately. I'll start putting things together now. 
    Problem is that these detailed cells models are difficult for me to make sense of. 
    Also, we don't want to replicate the blue brain project, 
    so we struggle to find a good middle ground.

    Multiple problems. 
    Probably the worst is that we're still not sure what research question to answer. 
    And it's not easy to just poke around (exploratory studies) because it is a multi-month/multi-year investment to use a model. 
    At least this is my impression. 
    I haven't really started because I'm quite certain that it would take that long
    and then you end up with a model that's basically just a single data point as 
    there are no real uncertainties associated to the parameters.

    I was thinking about using a simplified model like: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87002-7
    but that's also far from beautiful:

    distribute_distance(apical, "ghdbar_hd", "(1. + 3./100. * %.17g)*1.9042409723832741e-05")
    distribute_distance(apical, "e_pas", "(-65.726902768520958-5*%.17g/150)")
    distribute_distance(apical, "gkabar_kad", "(15./(1. + exp((300-%.17g)/50)))* 0.012921529390557651 ")
    distribute_distance(basal, "ghdbar_hd", "(1. + 3./100. * %.17g)*1.9042409723832741e-05")
    distribute_distance(basal, "e_pas", "(-65.726902768520958-5*%.17g/150)")
    distribute_distance(basal, "gkabar_kad", "(15./(1. + exp((300-%.17g)/50)))*0.012921529390557651")
    distribute_distance(somatic, "ghdbar_hd", "(1. + 3./100. * %.17g)*1.9042409723832741e-05")
    distribute_distance(somatic, "e_pas", "(-65.726902768520958-5*%.17g/150)")
