- Goal is to have same timestep integration method as NRN, Euler.
    - Not sure why this is necesary.
    - Why is the method of integration important for Sebastians comparisons?
        - LIF typically uses exact solvers.
        - Does use NEST use explicit time steps for LIF, or exact method?
    - What differences is Sebastian seeing?
