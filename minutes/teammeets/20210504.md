        * M30: larger network integrated into Ebrains, ingested from SONATA file

* What is a strategy anyway? List of promises/plans? We can just copy-paste.
    * Strategy is: not a list of promises and plans, but high level goals (have many points of contact in community so we're an essential tool that people are using, so we can get more funding :)
    * Let's write these out! Set date.
* Earlier, we wanted to use a strategy to extract releases/potential release notes.
