## The Release / Releasing

- #2028 is gtg
- Was waiting for #1990, #1979, but that is developing in larger requests.
- Observation: we're not very good at scoping!
    - How much new scope can we ask for in a PR?
    - Should we think of scope, once a PR is posted, in terms of time? What can we add in a week, instead of what is the best solution to $problem?
    -> Planning and making a release based on Issues/PRs is difficult if scope can be extended too much.
- Switch to timed releases, no planning required, I go through the motions every $period.
    - Allows us to maintain status quo wrt PR scope.
    - I still think we should consider 'scope expansion limits'

- Agreement: 1990 is not showstopper.
  -> Lennart will make #1990 discussion into a issue for the v0.9 or later release
- Bugfixes: please tag PR accordingly, and reviewers: please prioritize these and focus on merging them, spin off other ideas improvements in an issue
- Somebody review #2028, and hold off on merging new PRs until Brent gives the signal.
