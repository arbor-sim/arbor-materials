Arbor Team Meeting 2021 06 01
=============================

Meeting link: https://meet.google.com/kod-knuo-pie or https://webconf.fz-juelich.de/b/hui-8hm-slc-1ni
Collaborative editing: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/new
Turn Issues and PRs you want to discuss into agenda items.

Presence: NA, TH, BH, SY

Small items
===========
* A lot of new issues and PRs are being added, should we go through them (now or later) and assign them?
    * NORA: next week a meet to go over them.
* Minutes in repo: please do! All can push.
* Arbor strategy: lets pick a date.
    * BH makes doodle after TH puts holiday in calender.

This week in GUI
================

1. Simulation 'works', needs to be debugged
2. Catalogue loading
3. Started looking at binary artifacts. AppImage?
4. Can stack markers

Partners
========

* Robin has started using Arbor. I will have to spend part of this week helping with the verification efforts. Is this the modelers job or ours?
    * NA will start a how-to port page, with some steps that users can take when porting models. If this does not work, then please make a minimal models and make an Issue.
    * Can we have Arbor features that help debugging modelling?
        * SY had some ideas: 2nd order voltage solver can allow us to say make CVs and dts tiny in both NEURON and Arbor, without having to decrease dts as the square of the decrease in CV length.
        * Auto-simplifing morphologies (specifically: transforming morphology to a cylindrical simpler version).
        * Running NRN from ACC files?
* Ebrains T5.2: https://drive.ebrains.eu/smart-link/62176603-cc41-4e1a-a60d-16160f1ddbd2
    * 3) Moving to a simulator agnostic SONATA, such that Arbor and other simulators can ingest it.
        a. Model that can be taken as testcase: https://simulation-launcher-bsp-epfl.apps.hbp.eu/index.html#/circuits/hippo_mooc_sa_microcircuit
        b. Can the above pipeline be modified to output simulator agnostic Sonata?
            i. Cell descriptions in Sonata are either:
                1.	hoc+swc,
                2.	neuroml,
                3.	allen-json,
                4.	python
            ii. See also https://github.com/AllenInstitute/sonata/blob/master/docs/SONATA_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
            iii. The NeuroML pathway is most promising. Arbor support morphology, not mechanisms (we load catalogues!).
    * Is BRIAN multicompartment? Yes: https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/multicompartmental.html
