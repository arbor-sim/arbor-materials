# nmlcc

- discussions with Lennart
  - received IO NML model v2
  - working out the kinks/bugs
  - _fun_ with handling of ions/NON_SPECIFIC
- discussion with Padraig
  - port Hay et al 
- both models will be ported via nmlccc to Arbor
- results go to Bernstein/CNS/...

AMPA/NMDA synapses
==================

- [NA] and [TH] had a couple of meeting discussion the diffusion equation. 
- It is not immediately obvious how we can translate the equation into an ODE. 
- It seems to be the solution to a partial differential equation that underwent a number of simplifiations to arrive at the solution. 
- [SY] did have an idea of using 3 ODEs in a kinetic scheme to model this. [NA] contacted him for clarification.
- Anyone else interested in taking a look? 
- Options: 
    1. Use mechanism ABI
    2. Extend NMODL to allow for loops and arrays
    3. Create equivalent kinetic sceme

BluePyOpt vs Arbor
==================

* a quick reading of how cell models are generated by BluePyOpt suggests that generating Arbor compatible cell descriptions.
    * Python code that does generation: https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/blob/master/bluepyopt/ephys/create_hoc.py
    * jinja template targeted by Python code: https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/blob/master/bluepyopt/ephys/templates/cell_template.jinja2


CI/CD on Daint
==============

* bors try is launching runs, but not reporting results
* there are some seg faults on Daint... https://gitlab.com/cscs-ci/arbor-sim/arbor/-/jobs/2122174081

Exporting Symbols for (public) API
==================================
* PR is ready https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1824
* Lots of changes to all of arbor, allows for shared libraries
* Need a vote?
