## Nora's last week(s)
- Shall we do an online farewell?
    - Friday afternoon? Tuesday morning (12 April)
    - NA will let us know over Gitter

## Axial Diffusion is Back on the Menu
- `Xi` is not working for us, the semantics do not match
- So, invented `Xd` which is exclusively for diffusion
  - `Xd` is *not* reset
  - diffuses according to modified cable eq
  - At t=0 `Xd = Xi`
  - NMODL has direct access
  - No area weighting 
    - discuss?!
  - If two mechs write `Xd`: data race, tough luck. 
    - discuss?!
    - could use purely additive semantics instead, but then no `Xd = 42`.
  - Injection and Decay done via NMODL
    - Decay needs an ugly hack, as `Xd` is not (cannot be!) a `STATE`.
- Now
  - Diffusion is working, eyeballing seems sane.
  - Another round of interlock w/ SchmittS
  - Need to add probing.
  - Fix units/scaling.
  - Testing? How?

## Paper

* Robin needs moar coar hours (NA asks BC)
* 3 reviews (1 rejection, 2 accept with significant change)
    * Thursday, 14.4.2022: deadline for answers
    * Include CoreNeuron main point

## SDE

* my timeline was too optimistic, still some work to do
* fixed a few bugs regarding unique seed generation per mechanism
* 2 arrays of state needed (size = # mechanism instances) for random123 counter-based PRNG, independent of number of Wiener processes
* testing with 2-cell model now
* adding Euler-Maruyama solver (Fippa people need more than Cnexp)
* synapse collapsing (same mechanism) -> raises questions regarding noise, should it be supported?

## TODOs from WP5 Plenary
* **Internal Milestones**: The meeting decided to extend all internal milestones by  6 months to align with the project extension. Please let us know by replying to this email if you would prefer another due date for an [internal milestone](https://drive.ebrains.eu/smart-link/bc68d0df-25e8-4133-ac52-a2f69eec5c97/) for your Task. (Deadline: Friday April 8).
    * Fine for T5.2
    * BH pings FIPPA and ArborIO

* **Exploitation plans**: Please let us know by replying to this email by the end of the week (Friday, April 1, eob), If you would like to create an exploitation plan for your work in SGA3. As communicated from the innovation team of HBP, “All HBP results (or group of results if they are to be used together) that can be utilised in further research activities, or in developing, creating, and marketing a product, process or service or in standardisation activities, should have an exploitation plan. In short, project results (services / software / hardware / models / database / process) that can be of interest for other users (in HBP or outside) which will be available through any form of commercial or non-commercial exploitation.”
You may find attached some additional information in the mail.
--> **Shall we create such a plan for Arbor?**
    - Can we ask Evita to what extent being a publically available software package is already an exploitation plan? [AK] OK
    - Discuss in strategy meeting
