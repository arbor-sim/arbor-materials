## Fixed-dt #2053

- Found reason for performance regression at high event load (sorting)
- PR ready for review (lots of changes)
- Event handling different from original idea
  - events with time $t_s$ are delivered at simulation time
    $t_i = t_0 + i ~dt$  if $t_s  \in \left[t_i, t_i + dt\right);$
    (og proposal: shifted/staggered by half a time step $dt$)
  - could be changed with some effort

-> run even larger simulations to see if performance regressions get worse

## Catch Ctrl-C in run #2070

So I have implemented ^C detection for python by splitting up the simulation in parts of 1000 steps. This is done by checking a single flag at known memory location, so quite cheap. But we also need to re-acquire the python  Alternatively, we could use the simulation.set_epoch_callback() api. This is much cleaner, but then we run in two problems:

 - There might be an existing callback, that we need to layer on top off
 - There is no method to stop a simulation from the epoch_callback().

Two is the big problem. How do I go about this:

 - Breaking API change: the callback needs to return a flag that tells us whether we need to stop the simulation
 - Non-breaking API change: add a flag/callback to stop a running simulation
 - Non-breaking API change: add a new 'stopping' condition callback

-> No strong opinions. Let's try to do approach 1, if we can do it via an overload and non-breaking. Else let's go with approach 2. See if it passes PR review. Also think about saving data yes/no. Maybe intentionally stopping AND saving data is another PR, very intersting still

Now this part of the simulation is a bit complicated and I don't understand the entire epoch/next/prev thing, so maybe I need some help with the implementation as well.

## Summit registration

which options?

## Posters HBP Summit

- nmlcc: submitted
- BPO poster. Lukas?
- Lennart poster: IO network (?) - need to specify bit further what exactly, probably something that focusses on arbor and allows me to publish the full project later on. Was thinking about network tuning in arbor, that's maybe 5% overlap.
- Status Poster
    - Bit last minute, apologies
