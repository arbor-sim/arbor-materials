T5.2: the Sonata task
=====================

Jim (James King, CoreNeuron lead at EPFL) sent a mail last week. It was indeed discussed in the T5.2 in november, and to [BH] recollection there was no firm outcome: we want them to make things available in other formats to we can get them into Arbor, they didn't want to make that port.

Jim:

    Looking back at some notes I had written, I understood that you could look at models from our nmc-portal (https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/welcome.html) in order to export the biophysics and then use in SONATA. Is that not correct?

[BH] TODO note from that meet (june 23):

    ## plan

    0. Ask Werner van Geit where the Sonata file is (for the showcase), how the parameter setting happens. Those things are for their fixing.
    1. Use https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase as stepping stone to hippocampus mooc.
    2. we make the technical analysis neuroml dynamics
        * Can we avoid LEMS implementation? Is there any LEMS in https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase?
    3. in september, report estimate/progress to epfl
        * TH volunteers to do the deed ;)
    4. when implementation on track, ask them to start working on the morphology converter.
    
    Also:
    
    hippocampus mooc already meets M24 milestones. microcircuit in the mooc is already meeting the milestone.

    For M30, network description in Sonata format, not NML.

[TH]
- getting close to being able to run with NML2 dynamics.
  - that means the channels are there
  - needs testing (of course)
- we'll also want to convert the bio-physics automatically
  - that's the next step

[BC]: they can generate nml morph or hoc from their own description. question: will they eat their own nml? because we'd rely on their probably not well tested nml conversion.

Sonata is an output of their framework, not ingested by their own simulator.

Response to Jim:
- Report on our nml mech progress.
- What's their workflow?
- ask Werner van Geits Sonata file
    - What's their workflow? Is there any 
- ask what their plan is with nml morph output, will they ingest that as part of any comparison?
    - 
- sonata hdf5 network desc: Nora knows. Also, this part (network) is for M30, not M24

TODO: Continue in meeting tomorrow.

Meson, scikit-build, setup.py
=============================

We need a decision on direction and timeline, and choose which to merge:
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1784
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1797

[TH] 
- #1784 does not depend on sk_build as such, just its outputs
  - public headers in site_packages/arbor
  - tools and data in the same place
  - both portable and well defined, that was enabled by sk-b
      - Could we remove skbuild then? That would make Meson builds easier, no need to undo skbuild related changes to setup.py
  - so, if/when the meson branch does this for us, we can just swap that part
  - therefore, it's not really either-or
- #1797 has some other things that are nice to have
    - Add nml status to config(). ('bundled' added as well.)
    - Add build-wheels.sh to scripts/ which can be used to generate manylinux wheels using docker/podman.
    - TODO: move these into #1784.
- meson is moving quickly, much more than anticipated
  - that's great!
  - when do we make it official?
      - later

Max's distributed gap junctions
===============================
https://github.com/max9901/arbor/tree/exploration/distrgj
 
- Ask Max for a description of his implementation (something similar to what would go in a PR description)
- Perhaps a meeting where he walks us through the code. 
- Ask for benchmark results. 

AMPA/GABA synapses
==================

-  We wonâ€™t require connection-local state variables as previously thought. We still do need to figure out how to translate diffusion into ODE.
-  Notes from meeting on 21.12.21
    -  https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=128446&file=%2fShortTermPlasticityMFGRC_Nieus2006%2fAmpa.mod#tabs-2
    -  Diffusion can be modeled as 3 states (using a kinetic scheme?):
        -  state 1: Multiple synapses have fired, but the glutamate hasn't "arrived" yet.
        -  state 2: The glutamate has arrived. 
        -  state 3: The glutamate has been dealt with.
    -  x, y, z ODEs should be solved every dt. 
    -  `net_send` we can model that with a variable f such that `df/dt` = -1. Everytime a spike comes in, we add to it; if f>0 we're in the square wave, if f<0 we're outside, when a spike comes in we reset f or add to it. 
    -  There will be 3 kinetic schemes:
        -  Kinetic scheme for the pre-synaptic site (x, y, z).
        -  Kinetic scheme for the post-synaptic site (O, C, D).
        -  Kinetic scheme for the diffusion (to be written).
    -  The rate variable for the post-synaptic kinetic scheme depends on the solved variables of the diffusion kinetic scheme. We may need to write this as a set of ODEs.

- TODO: next week make this the first topic
    - Brent can work with Nora to implement the model.

    }

    function curr(s: state_rec, v_minus_ek: voltage): current/area {

    evolve s' = rate(s, v);
