Some updates
======

* TAQT responded: also available 28 and 29 April. Please reserve those days, and that week.
* Succesfully inserted a little bit of Arbor into Michele's all Neuron Brain Simulation School
    * https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/education/BRAINSIM/
    * Thanks Egidio, Claudia and Robin
    * TODO: ask Michele if we can be present next time?
* Mario Negrello
    * Raised https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1655 (Stochastic ODEs)
        * An M21 milestone depends on it. Has a student to use it. v0.8 timeline is OK, but no later.
        * Fabian is working on this feature
        * Brent introduces Fabian to Mario's student.
    * Interested in setting up some Ebrains workflows, but not succesful.
        * Brent will help.
    * A PhD for L.
* First review on perf comp paper in
    * "Why didn't you include CoreNeuron, they surely would cooperate with that."
        * is part of 'core NRN'?
            * Brent: ask Robin how involved expanding (?) BSB for CoreNRN would be?
        * Because it has been a pain to setup. Might be better now with `pip`.
            * Would that get you GPU support?
        * CoreNRN is a CMAKE option for NRN.

# NML

- Got Lennart's system from IO running on vanilla nmlcc
- Still need to tweak input nml due to lack of `area`
    - what does nml need to know `area` for?

# Juwels GPU Workshop

- Got scaling results up to 2.1M cells on 800 GPUs at 80% par eff
  - Can we publish this result in some way?
      - Website first, then ask FZJ/CSCS/HBP to tweet
      - 
- Some items on the 'could be improved list'
  - eliding d2d copies
      - specifically Xi abd Xo concentrations of ions when there are no mechs that contribute to them.
  - eliminating per CV dt :wink: @ben
    - BC: can we quantify the impact of this?
- Absolutely horrifying: Large KINETIC
  - QR?
  - RK?
  - better code
      - BC: is it horrifying; it is a large complicated computation.
  - Row wise normalisation was an issue
      - this may no longer be required now that other numeric issues that required this feature have been fixed.
- SEGV in modcc
  - uninitialised variable in `LinearRewriter`
- NSuite
  - backport arbor 0.6

PR review assignment 
====================
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pulls
- PRs are piling up again 
- submodularisation of random123
    - their github repo seems out of sync with website?
    - brent submodularizes.
