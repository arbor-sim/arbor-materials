Concept overview diagram
========================

Reduce recipe here (dont expand the 'subcomponents'), make context, domdec, sim seperate boxes and show how they are related. (arrow=calls into, otherarrow=used in construction)

C++20 hardening [TH]
====================
- See https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1479
- Take a look at the history of these construction

Mech ABI [TH]
=============
Any last minute comments/wishes, before I polish it for the final review?
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1452

Explicit generators [NA]
========================

https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1488
This is a prerequisite for the synapse identification issue, and I will handle it separately.

- Add labels for i_clamps (and just ignore them)

Autodoc [BH]
============

It can't be done, type info is lost until issues in both Sphinx and Python issues are fixed; https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1172. There is a half manual/automated way: dump the docstrings to `.rst`, touchup by hand.

- Stub file `.pyi`, but not used in sphinx
- Potentially: Dump directly from our pybind headers.
    - Sphinx plugin that patches docutils: https://github.com/brenthuisman/sphinx-autodoc-cache
- Conclusion: Horrible mess, do not fix.

Request for Review
==================

- Some docs css/markup: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1483
    - Neurlucida -> Neurolucida
- Small bug fix: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1485
- SVE bug fix: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1485
- `ubench` update: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1453
- https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1476
  - [TH] I am partially involved, so I'd rather not review it

GUI [TH]
========

So much stuff.
- ACC I/O.
- More speed wrt to picking.
  - can also tune the frustrum subdivisions ... my MacBook had issues.
- Phinally proper probing.
- i_clamps w/ preview.
- some reorganisation of the interface.
- getting started on _running_ simulations from the GUI.

Next up: Discretisation display

Partners
========

* After the ArborIO meeting, I looked at the nmodl mechanism using `surfaceArea`. It's supposed to be the cross-sectional area so it seems it's a bug that Rocher is going to fix.
