Spikes on Gap Junctions
=======================
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1709

- meeting before the break: Lennart, NA, BH, TH, AK
- Solution proposed that does not require changes to Arbor. 

AMPA/GABA synapses
==================
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1764
https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor-materials/blob/master/minutes/teammeets/20211221.md#ampanmda-synapses

- meeting before the break: NA, SY, AK
- Cleared up a misunderstanding on SY's part. We won't require connection-local state variables as previously thought. We still do need to figure out how to translate diffusion into ODE. 
- [NA] I had some extra notes on this that I can't find right now. Will look them up before next week. 

Meson
======

Branch: https://github.com/bcumming/arbor/tree/meson
Main build file: https://github.com/bcumming/arbor/blob/meson/meson.build

- now almost feature complete. Still to implement
    - hip and cuda-clang
    - `setup.py` / pip (requires some up front design, or waiting for PEP 517)
        - Earlier discussion on PEP517: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1695
    - out of tree catalogue builds
- Process has been smooth
    - meson files are shorter and simpler
    - better docs
    - all features required are available (so far)
- Questions
    - What are the downsides?
        - None :)
    - CMake interop
        - in theory good: meson can read and generate cmake configs (extent of support not known)

Other packaging
===============

* git submodules
    * meson motivated?
* scikit-build
    * turns out our (previous) pip packages did not build with nml/libxml!
    * sb maintainers are config hostile, pip/pypa folks too!

Partners
========

* Max's initial implementation for distributed gap junctions is ready: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/issues/1766
